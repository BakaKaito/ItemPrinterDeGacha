Calculation tool for Scarlet/Violet's Item Printer to forecast results from various print jobs.

The game uses time_t to seed the RNG on first launch of the printer, for the rest of the session.

The tool is a work-in-progress, so there currently is no user-friendly release until the dust settles. Keen users can compile it same as other C# tools with the latest Visual Studio on Windows. A console app is also available (minimal command line support).
