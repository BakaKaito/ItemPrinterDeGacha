### Issues

When submitting an issue, please use an issue template and try to fill out everything correctly.

Please be patient when expecting a response; this is free software and we aren't available at all times.

### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request, please try to have everything ready for merging (no merge conflicts). Draft pull requests may be rejected as we value having a minimal amount of open issues/pull requests!

Please make sure your code is maintainable; provide comments and xmldoc when appropriate. If you are coding new GUI features, ensure any non-GUI logic is separate from the GUI specific logic; separating concerns is important for maintainability and portability!

### Formatting

Spaces instead of tabs. Please follow the standard C# formatting rules provided by Visual Studio and the `editorconfig`
